print("ðŸ“‹ Features implemented:")
print("â€¢ Detects up to 50 objects at once")
print("â€¢ Color-coded bounding boxes for different object types")  
print("â€¢ Real-time object counting and grouping")
print("â€¢ Enhanced performance optimization")
print("â€¢ Works in both OpenCV and Gradio interfaces")

print("ðŸš€ How to test multi-object detection:")
print()
print("1. Run: python main.py")
print("   Choose option 7: Object Detection Only")
print("   OR option 8: Combined Gesture + Object Detection")
print("   OR option 10: Gradio Web Interface")
print()
print("2. Place multiple objects in front of your camera:")
print("   - Books, cups, phones, keyboards, etc.")
print("   - The system will detect and count ALL visible objects")
print("   - Different object types get different colored boxes")
print()
print("3. For web interface testing:")
print("   - Go to http://localhost:7860")
print("   - The interface shows detailed statistics")
print("   - Real-time multi-object detection with gesture recognition")
print()
print("ðŸŽ® What you'll see:")
print("â€¢ Each object gets a colored bounding box")
print("â€¢ Object names and confidence scores")
print("â€¢ Total object count and types")
print("â€¢ Real-time performance statistics")
print()
print("ðŸ”§ Technical improvements made:")
print("â€¢ Lower confidence threshold (0.4) to catch more objects")
print("â€¢ Increased max_det to 50 objects per frame")
print("â€¢ Optimized IOU threshold for better multi-detection")
print("â€¢ Enhanced color coding system")
print("â€¢ Improved labeling and statistics display")
print()
print("ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Try these scenarios:")
print("â€¢ Place 5+ different objects on your desk")
print("â€¢ Show multiple books or devices")
print("â€¢ Test with objects at different distances")
print("â€¢ Use the combined mode for gesture + multi-object detection")
print()
print("âœ… The system is ready! Run python main.py to start.")
