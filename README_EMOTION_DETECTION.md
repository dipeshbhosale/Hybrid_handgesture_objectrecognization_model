# üé≠ Emotion Detection Integration

This extension adds facial emotion detection capabilities to the Hybrid Ultimate Detection System.

## üìã Features

- **Real-time emotion recognition** using DeepFace
- **Seven emotions detected**: happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, fear, disgust
- **Emoji visualization** for quick emotion identification
- **Optimized performance** (8-15 FPS on CPU)
- **Emotion logging** to track emotions over time
- **Seamless integration** with the existing Hybrid Detection System

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Run the emotion detection launcher:
   ```
   python launch_emotion_detection.py
   ```

2. Choose from the menu options:
   - **Option 1**: Run standalone emotion detection
   - **Option 2**: Run with hybrid integration (recommended)
   - **Option 3**: Toggle emotion logging on/off
   - **Option 4**: View emotion log analysis

### Keyboard Controls

When running the emotion detection:

- Press `q` to quit
- Press `e` to toggle emotion detection on/off
- Press `l` to toggle emotion logging on/off
- Press `s` to save the current frame

## üîß Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The main dependencies are:
- DeepFace
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas (for logging)

## üß© Integration with Hybrid System

The emotion detection system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing Hybrid Ultimate Detection System:

1. It uses YOLO face detection when available for better performance
2. It adds emotion recognition to detected faces
3. It maintains compatibility with all existing features
4. It adds emotion data to detection results

## üìä Emotion Logging

When enabled, emotion logging will save detected emotions to `emotion_logs.csv` with:

- Timestamp
- Face ID
- Detected emotion
- Confidence score

This data can be analyzed using the built-in analysis tool (Option 4) or exported to Excel/other tools for further analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimization

The system includes several optimizations:

- **Frame skipping**: Automatically adjusts to maintain target FPS
- **Face region extraction**: Only processes face regions for faster analysis
- **Caching**: Maintains last detected emotions for smooth display

## üîç Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with DeepFace installation, try:
  ```
  pip install deepface --no-deps
  pip install tensorflow opencv-python
  ```

- If emotion detection is slow, the system will automatically adjust by increasing frame skipping

- Make sure your camera is well-lit for better face detection and emotion recognition accuracy
